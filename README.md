# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-and-Logistic-Regression
This repository contains a Python project that predicts car prices using both linear and logistic regression models. The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis and comparison of these two regression techniques in the context of car price prediction.

Project Overview
Predicting car prices is a valuable application in the automotive industry, enabling manufacturers, dealers, and customers to make informed decisions. This project leverages linear and logistic regression algorithms to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

Features
Data Collection: A detailed dataset containing various attributes of cars.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data distribution and relationships.
Linear Regression Model: Implementing and training a linear regression model to predict continuous car prices.
Logistic Regression Model: Implementing and training a logistic regression model for classification tasks related to car pricing categories.
Model Evaluation: Comparing the performance of both models using appropriate metrics.
Visualization: Visualizing the results and the model predictions
